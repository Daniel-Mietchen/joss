# Announcing The Journal of Open Source Software

The Journal of Open Source Software is an [open source](http://github.com/openjournals/joss) developer-friendly journal for research software packages. It's designed to make it as easy as possible to create a software paper for research software. If a piece of software is already well documented, then paper preparation and submission [should take no more than an hour](http://joss.theoj.org/about#author_guidelines) and happens at http://joss.theoj.org .

JOSS papers are deliberately extremely short and only allowed to include:

- A short abstract describing the high-level functionality of the software (and perhaps a figure)
- A list of the authors of the software (together with their affiliations)
- A list of key references including a link to the software archive

Paper are not allowed to include other things such as descriptions of API functionality, as this should be included in the software documentation. You can see an example of a paper [here](https://github.com/arfon/fidgit/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf).

Software papers are currently the best solution for gaining career credit for software but building high quality software is already a lot of work. JOSS is designed to make the process of writing a software paper as quick as possible.

More details including author submission guidelines are available at http://joss.theoj.org/about
